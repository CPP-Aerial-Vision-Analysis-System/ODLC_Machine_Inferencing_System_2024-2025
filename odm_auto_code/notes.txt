Make changes to current directories in main.py and copy_transfer.py
run_files.py will work 

"process" variable may need to be changed to correctly reflect what would be done in Linux. 
This is on line 8 on main.py

source_folder would create a results folder in the same folder as the python files

image_folder location is the input folder that ODM will scan and analyze
https://www.opendronemap.org/odm/datasets/ 

pip install -U pyodm 

Be sure to have docker installed and Running

With pyodm installed, you should be able to run the python files. Be sure Docker is running in the background or errors may occur.

For copy_transfer.py, be sure to have the path for the destination_folder is defined.

main.py can be run by itself as well as copy_transfer.py

mapping_trans.sh is a simple shell script that just run the files in the same folder, there shouldnt be any problem to it in my assumption.

Note: 

Instructions for PyODM and ODM can also be seen on the main.py file on line 67.

If you wish to see the 3d renders of a location. You can open WebODM but it will need to download the repo and follow the instructions given on their markdown file
https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/WebODM?tab=readme-ov-file#run-the-docker-version-as-a-linux-service

ODM:
https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/ODM 

Stated that easiest way to run it is through docker for terminal use, doing a docker run with the dataset.
