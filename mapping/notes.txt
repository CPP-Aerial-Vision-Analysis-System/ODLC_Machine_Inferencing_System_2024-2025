Key modifications for live stitching:

Uses video capture instead of loading static images
Processes frames in real-time
Updates reference frame continuously
Includes error handling for dropped frames


Limitations to consider:

Performance may be slower due to real-time processing
Memory usage increases over time
Quality might be lower than batch processing
May need additional optimization for real-time performance
Camera movement should be relatively slow and smooth

You would also need to adjust parameters like:

Feature detection threshold
Matching distance threshold
Minimum match count
Frame capture rate

For better performance, you might want to:

Resize frames to smaller dimensions
Process every nth frame instead of all frames
Use GPU acceleration if available
